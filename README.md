# hello-world
This is the Hello World repository

I created this repository because I am truly ecstatic about Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub

Now I am equally ecstatic about committing this from VS Code

This is a code written in the vscode-branch

I am trying to merge this branch to master

Let's see if I am able to commit this to GitHub from SurfaceProX

And now from VSCode using WSL
